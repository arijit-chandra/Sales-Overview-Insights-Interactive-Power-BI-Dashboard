### Data Cleaning & Formatting
- Cleaned raw transactional data using SQL queries  
- Handled missing, null, and inconsistent values  
- Standardized date, currency, and numeric formats  
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant records  
- Applied appropriate data type conversions  

### Data Transformation
- Created calculated columns and aggregated metrics using SQL  
- Joined multiple tables to create analysis-ready datasets  
- Normalized and structured data for efficient modeling  
- Optimized SQL queries to improve performance and reduce load time  

### CSV Extraction
- Exported cleaned and transformed datasets into **CSV files**  
- Designed CSV schemas optimized for Power BI ingestion  
- Ensured reusability and scalability of extracted data  

The finalized CSV files were then imported into **Power BI** for modeling, calculations, and visualization.
